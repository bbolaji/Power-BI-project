                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>*Data Warehousing integration & ETL*

*Project:*
Company *** is a retail chain with multiple stores across the country. They recently acquired another smaller retail chain and
            need to integrate the new company’s data into the existing datawarehouse. The data from the new company is in a 
            different format and stored in a legacy system.

*Solution:*
Data Integration:You begin by analyzing the data schemas of both companies to identify differences and similarities.
ETL Process:You design an ETL process to extract data from the legacy system, transform it into a consistent format that 
              matches your existing data warehouse structure, and load it into the data warehouse.
Data Cleansing:As part of the transformation, you apply data cleansing rules to handle inconsistencies such as duplicate 
               records, missing values, and incorrect data formats.
Data Validation:After loading, you perform data validation checks to ensure that the data is accurate and complete.
Outcome:The integrated data warehouse now provides a unified view of both companies’ operations, enabling the business 
        to analyze performance across all stores.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>The finance department needs a dashboard that tracks monthly expenses across various departments to identify
                   areas of overspending. They also want to forecast the budget for the next quarter based on historical 
                    spending patterns </p>

                <h3>Project 3</h3>
                <p>*Scenario:The marketing department requests an analysis of customer purchasing behavior to identify which 
                    product categories are frequently bought together. They want to use this information to create targeted 
                    promotions.
                Solution: You write a complex SQL query that joins the sales, customer, and product tables. You use window functions to rank the products by frequency of purchase and subqueries to find the 
                most common pairings.</p>
